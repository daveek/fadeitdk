					<h1 class="regular-title">Hi there, stranger</h1>
					<p class="regular-text">
						First of all, congrats on cracking that piece of code. We're excited to know that you are curious and willing to explore.
					</p>

					<h3 class="regular-title apply-space">Who are we looking for?</h3>
					<p class="regular-text">
						Technology landscapes are changing fast, with new software rolling out on a daily basis - what is considered cutting-edge today, can become obsolete tomorrow. Here at fadeit we value the ability to learn.<br/>
						You don't have to be familiar with technologies from our <a href="#!/toolbox">toolbox</a> (although it's an advantage). We're looking for someone who is fast at picking stuff up and most importantly - motivated to improve.
					</p>

					<h3 class="regular-title">What do we offer?</h3>
					<p class="regular-text">
                                                We offer an opportunity to work with quality Free Software and Open Source tools and to do real web development using best practices. Do you like back-end development or want to build awesome front-end user experiences? Perhaps you look to improve your Linux skills or acquire IT automation expertise? Is there something else that you find fascinating? Chances are that we have a place for you.
