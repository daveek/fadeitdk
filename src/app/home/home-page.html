          Software made secure

        <p>
          Software security is essentially a catch-up game which is impossible to win.<br/>
          While new attack vectors are being used every day, it is important to stay on <br/>
          top of the game. Our software choices are influenced by the vendorâ€™s<br/>
          perspective on security as well as making sure that the choices we<br/>
          make today are supported tomorrow.

          Scaling and portability are pain-points for many companies.<br/>
          They are often the primary reason for using out-dated legacy software solutions.<br/>
          We belive in software that is ready for change, ready to adapt.

            No more constraints, the browser can do it all. With the rise of HTML5, the limits of what a browser can do have been scraped.<br/>

           From thin client to thick front, single page applications are changing how we interact with the browser.<br/>
           Responsive design will make sure that our software works on mobile devices just-as-well.<br/>
           When just-as-well is not good enough, our solutions can be ported to mobile platforms so they are treated as first class citizens.
