Services / HTTP reqs, routing, promises (just to name a few) are not among Vue’s concerns. That’s good and bad. Perhaps \"bad\" is an exaggeration; but it’s a negative aspect for someone that got used to Angular and didn't have to lift a finger for it. In other words, we have to mix and match libraries as we go to cover our needs. That can be quite a task, but some developers love having this kind of control (others think it’s a waste of time). However, once you find a few good libraries, you won’t have to do it again. I think this kind of flexibility is very empowering. Imagine building your own smaller, focused framework (like Angular) on top of a good foundation: Vue. <br/><br/> Creating a personalized front-end stack is great fun too. The first stack I ended up with was made out of: Director (routing), Reqwest (you guessed it), Q (promises) and of course Vue. The best name I can make out of these is QRVD (kinda sounds like curved). For the rest of the article you could have this stack in mind, although it won’t change much if you don’t."

In my first encounter, I though of it as a drastically simplified Angular Controller, managing the data flow across the application (without the need of an equivalent to <em>$scope</em>. By default, components will have an isolated scope. That makes this directive essential, although components also accept <em>inherit</em> as a property (see <a target='_blank' href='http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Scope_Inheritance'>more on scope inheritance</a>)."

That's not even the worst part. If you are just starting with Angular, you probably won’t come across a good structuring guide, which is a shame. It’s only later (or maybe too late) that Angular developers decide to look into it. <br/><br/> So how does Vue.js perform? More or less the same. There's a very short section in the <a href='http://vuejs.org/guide/application.html' target='_blank'>Vue guide</a> about app structuring, but it's not enough. I believe developers are able to produce kick-ass modular architectures with Vue, but there are no comprehensive guides or suggestions on how to do it.

It wasn't easy to tell how it all fits together. On one hand, components weren't properly separated, but this doesn’t have anything to do with Vue. So it was time for taking a step back, analyzing and refactoring. I sketched out my components and tried to create a structure that would make things better. <br/><br/> Before you check out the diagram below, it is worth mentioning that Browserify was used to split components up.
