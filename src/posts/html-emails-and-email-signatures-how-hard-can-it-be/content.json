For those that know nothing about Oren, he's been developing stuff for the past 20 years. In his career he worked with machine learning, distributed computing and compilers, just to name a few. He moved on to web development afterwards, which he admits in the podcast was 'the really hard stuff'. I know many of you would be tempted to close this article, run outside and burst into tears of joy... but there's actually more to this post! <br/> Web development <b>is hard</b> indeed. It also seems like it's not going to get easier anytime soon. Hell, the next generation of web developers won't be able to work on a so called 'web application' without using some sort of transpiler. You will be the laughing stock of the web if you are still writing in ES5 (or ES6 in about a year or so). The days of writing code in Notepad++ and refreshing a page in a browser are gone and they are not coming back. <br/> So... you need to know all the new stuff, but that's not enough. You also need to know all the old stuff, because the web is not your colleague with a MacBook Pro using the latest version of Chrome. The web is any device with an internet connection, so we have to develop accordingly. I'll say it again:<br/><br/>"

I am not talking about JS frameworks here or smartphone apps, but the stuff 'under the hood': the way we think of progressive enhancement (after all, we should learn from past mistakes), mobile-first designs, responsive layouts, etc. <br/> You see, a lot of these revolutionary changes are strongly related to layout. In fact, web layout is changing again as we speak (web-time, not human-time). We moved from tables, wacky flash sites knew how to navigate, grids, now (almost) flexbox, tomorrow CSS shapes / multi columns layouts and who knows... as VR enters mainstream - some kind of 3D layout that we can't even imagine yet."

Everybody is free to do whatever they want. <br/> I am not thinking about crazy things here. It would be enough if we could ditch table layouts and inline styles. I would also be happy if email clients would have some basic support for media queries. Sure, it would be even nicer if we were able to do CSS3 animations or whatnot, but that's not what I really care about."
