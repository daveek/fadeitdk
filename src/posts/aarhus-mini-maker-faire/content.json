This weekend, <a href=\"http://www.euregme.com/pre/aarhus-city-of-smiles/\" target=\"_blank\">City of Smiles</a> is hosting yet another maker event - <a href=\"http://makerfaireaarhus.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Aarhus Mini Maker Fair</a>. While the original Maker Fair of San Matteo, California is celebrating its 10 year anniversary this year, our city is relatively new to this, having started in 2014. Regardless, the first event was a huge success and we want more!"
