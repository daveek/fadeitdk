In the tests, I would rebuild the database before every \"describe\" block. This worked quite well but at one point I noticed that my feedback loops were beginning to get tediously slow (~30 seconds to run the full test suite). Thankfully, I discovered mock-couch: in-memory storage with CouchDB API. The switch was rather easy and, as a result, my test suite would finish in less than 10 seconds (even when reseting test data before each test)."
